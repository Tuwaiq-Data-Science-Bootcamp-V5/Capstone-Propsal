Project Title:

Salik (Detect visual Pollution in the road) 

Group Members:

- Ali Al mutairi
- Saleh Abdullah
- Abdullah Alajalin

Objectives:

- Minimize visual pollution through urban planning
- Reduce Maintenance Costs 
- Improve road safety 

Dataset Description:

Visual Pollution (VP) is the visible deterioration and bad aesthetic quality of the natural and human-made landscapes. It also refers to the disruptive occurrence that limits the movability of the people on the public roads such as excavation barriers, potholes, and dilapidated sidewalks. The real VP dataset is collected from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) regions via the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing (MOMRAH) and used to develop the proposed deep learning framework.

- The number of images : 

| Train| Val |
| ----- | -------- |
| 24,553 | 7,242|

- The number of classes: 3 ['barriers', 'sidewalks', 'pothole']

- Columns Description (meaning): ↑  ↑  ↑

- The number of Missing values: There is no missing values
