# Capstone Project: Ibn Sena AI Medical System

## Group Members:

1. Abdullah AlFayez
2. Zayed AlHarbi
3. Mohammed AlZidani

## Objectives:

The main goal of this project is to develop an AI medical system that leverages multiple datasets to address various medical imaging challenges. The objectives include:

- Implementing Deep Learing and Machine Learning algorithms for diseases.
- Developing a comprehensive medical system that integrates different datasets seamlessly.
- Evaluating the performance of machine learning and deep learning models on diverse medical tasks.
- Creating a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to interact with the AI system.

## (Machine Learning / Deep Learning) Algorithms:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
2. YOLOv8 for object detection tasks.
3. Transfer learning using pre-trained models for feature extraction.
4. We used a lot of Machine Learning Algorithms on parkinson disease then we choosed the best Algorithm.
