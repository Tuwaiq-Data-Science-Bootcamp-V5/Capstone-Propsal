## Dataset :
The dataset encompasses diverse information pertaining to Riyadh's cafes and restaurants, organized by neighborhood with corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates within a 1500-meter radius. Details include ratings, the number of ratings received, and the proximity of offices, companies, and hotels in the vicinity. Additionally, the dataset incorporates user reviews for each establishment, limited to a maximum of 10 reviews per place, along with the associated user ratings. Demographic insights are provided, featuring neighborhood-wise population figures and age distribution statistics, segmented into groups ranging from 0 to 100 years. Further demographic nuances include labor rates categorized by age group and gender. The dataset also comprises the names of Riyadh's neighborhoods in both Arabic and English, accompanied by geographic coordinates outlining neighborhood borders. Notably, information about available rental spaces in Riyadh is included, specifically focusing on stores, with details such as price, space, and relevant attributes for the Saudi context. It is worth noting that the dataset was meticulously filtered to exclusively include stores located within Riyadh.
 ## Algorithms:
We used:
 * DNN for sentiment.
 * K-mean for success clustering.
 * Random forest for location effect on success.
